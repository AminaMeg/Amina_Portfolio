# [Project1: Grad student admission predictor](https://github.com/AminaMeg/Grad-Admission-Predictor)
*	Collect datasets of grad admission records from USIEF website to analyze which of the factors (GPA, GRE, TOFEL, Work Experience) is more required to be admitted.
*	Using different supervised machine learning algorithms (Decision tree, na√Øve bayes, KNN) to analyze the data and predict the admission of the student. 
*	Evaluating the accuracy of the results using Confusion matrix and ROC Curve. 
# Project2 : Movie Recommendation System 
*	Creating a platform that uses a filtering process to offer users various contents based on their preferences and based on information about other users with similar viewing preferences. 
*	Aggregate data from IMDB, use tf-idf algorithm and cosine similarity algorithm to build a recommendation system and compare between the content base and the collaborative filtering algorithm.
*	Improve tf-idf algorithm to alleviate the cold start problem in the collaborative filtering algorithm. 
# [Project3: Exploring Emotional Analysis about Covid-19 ](https://github.com/AminaMeg/Emotional-Analysis_covid19)
*	Leverage 100K+ Tweets to develop sentiment analysis model aiming to study the emotions of people regarding the Covid-19 outbreak in distinct periods of time.
*	Use Python libraries to collect and clean data. 
*	Analyze tweets word by word using natural language processing (NLP) and NRC Emotion Lexicon to study different emotions that people are experiencing during the pandemic.   
# [Project4 : Analyze student sentiment on online learning](https://github.com/AminaMeg/Analyze-student-sentiment-on-online-learning-) 
*	Collect 1M comments from tweeter and Instagram to analyze the student reaction about online studies and classify their emotions into groups. 
*	Using NLP to create a sentiment analysis of the tweets. 
* Apply supervised machine learning algorithms (SVM, Ridge regression, kNN) to classify the student emotions into (positive, negative, neutral). 
*	Cluster the student comments using K-Means clustering. 
* Evaluating the different algorithms used and study their efficiencies.
